We sat down with Neetu Verma, Senior Product Manager at Denave India Pvt. Ltd and ended up being inspired by her story and her perspective towards life and work. Read about her journey in her own words.

Hi all, I’m Neetu Verma, Senior Manager – Product, at Denave India Pvt. Ltd and a mother to two kids. An avid reader, passionate dancer and a closet philosopher, pretty much sums up everything about me. A mother and an engineer – the journey have been riddled with anxiety and enthusiasm, both in generous doses while striving to achieve a work-life balance and making room for new responsibilities in the best possible way.
